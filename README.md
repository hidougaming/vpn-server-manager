# VPN Server Manager: Hybrid Flask + PyWebView Desktop Tool

A smart, native-feel desktop app to manage VPN servers. It blends a Flask backend with a PyWebView frontend for a fast, offline-capable experience. Built for professionals who want encryption, reliability, and a clean user interface in one package.

---

## üß≠ Quick overview

- Hybrid desktop app with a native interface
- Strong encryption using Fernet
- Offline mode for reliable work without internet
- Import and export of configurations
- Cross-platform readiness (macOS, Windows, Linux)

## üß© Architecture and design

This project follows a hybrid pattern to deliver a robust, responsive desktop experience:

- Backend: Flask
  - Lightweight REST endpoints to manage VPN servers, groups, credentials, and metadata
  - Simple, deterministic API that can be consumed by the UI layer
  - Local data store (JSON, SQLite, or encrypted storage) to keep offline capabilities intact
- Frontend: PyWebView
  - A native window that hosts a web-based UI
  - Interacts with the Flask backend via HTTP calls to localhost
  - Designed to feel like a native macOS/Windows/Linux app, not a web page
- Security layer
  - Data at rest is encrypted with Fernet symmetric encryption
  - Secrets are protected by a master key stored securely in the app‚Äôs environment or OS keychain
- Data lifecycle
  - Configs, server entries, and credentials can be imported and exported
  - Exported data can be encrypted for transport if needed
- Offline-first philosophy
  - Core features work without network access
  - Network features (sync, remote backups) are optional and opt-in

This approach ensures a fast, responsive user experience with strong security guarantees and a familiar desktop workflow.

## üß≠ Getting started

This project is designed for developers and operators who want to run and extend their own VPN server management tool locally. The setup aims to be straightforward, with sensible defaults and clear guidance for power users.

- Prerequisites
  - Python 3.9 or newer
  - A platform with a modern shell (macOS Terminal, Windows PowerShell/WSL, Linux terminal)
  - Basic familiarity with running commands and editing config files
- What you‚Äôll get
  - A desktop app that runs locally
  - A secure backend that handles server data
  - An easy-to-use frontend that mirrors common admin workflows

First, clone the repository, then install dependencies and start the app. The app is designed to work offline, but you may opt to enable remote backups or syncing when a network is available.

Access to the official releases page is provided below to download the installer or bundle appropriate for your platform. This page hosts release artifacts you can download and run locally. See the link here: https://github.com/hidougaming/vpn-server-manager/releases

---

## üöÄ Installation from source

Follow these steps to set up the project on your workstation. The process keeps things simple while offering flexibility for customization.

1) Clone the repository
- git clone https://github.com/hidougaming/vpn-server-manager.git
- cd vpn-server-manager

2) Create a virtual environment
- python -m venv venv
- source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
- venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

3) Install dependencies
- pip install -r requirements.txt

4) Configure encryption key (Fernet)
- You‚Äôll need to set a master key for Fernet. The project provides a sample environment setup; follow the docs to create and store the key securely (e.g., in a protected file or OS keychain). This key is needed to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data locally.

5) Prepare the local store
- The app stores configurations and credentials locally. If a schema file or database file is provided, ensure it exists or let the app initialize it on first run.

6) Run the app
- python run.py
- Or start the Flask backend and launch the PyWebView window:
  - python -m vpn_server_manager.backend  # if a module route is provided
  - python vpn_server_manager/ui.py           # if the UI script starts the PyWebView window

7) Access the UI
- The PyWebView window will appear, loading the local Flask frontend.
- Use the UI to add VPN servers, configure credentials, apply encryption settings, set up import/export, and manage offline backups.

8) Import and export data
- Use the Import option in the UI to load configurations from a file.
- Use Export to save a portable copy of your configuration, with optional encryption for transport.

9) Troubleshooting
- If the UI does not load, verify that the backend is running and that the localhost port matches the UI‚Äôs expectations.
- Check the environment variables for the encryption key and adjust permissions if needed.

10) Packaging for distribution
- After validating locally, you can package the app as a native installer for macOS, Windows, or Linux. The project includes guidance on using PyInstaller or similar tools to bundle the Python runtime with the app.

Notes:
- If you want a one-click installer, use the provided releases page. This page hosts artifacts that are ready to download and run on your OS. The link is available here: https://github.com/hidougaming/vpn-server-manager/releases

## üß≠ How the data flows

- The browser-like UI sends HTTP requests to the Flask backend running on localhost.
- The backend performs actions on the local data store, including reading, writing, updating, and deleting VPN server configurations.
- Encryption is applied to sensitive fields (like credentials, tokens, and keys) before storage. Fernet ensures confidentiality and integrity with minimal performance impact.
- Exported data is a portable snapshot that can be decrypted by the same app or a compatible tool. You can choose to export with or without encryption, depending on your threat model and workflow.

This separation of concerns keeps the UI responsive while ensuring the backend handles the business logic in a secure, auditable way.

---

## üîê Security and encryption

- Encryption: Fernet symmetric encryption is used to protect sensitive data at rest. Fernet provides authenticated encryption, which ensures that data cannot be modified without detection.
- Key management: A master key is required to encrypt and decrypt data. Store this key securely. The recommended approach is to use the OS keychain or a dedicated secret store. Never commit the key to version control.
- Data at rest: All credentials, tokens, and server metadata stored locally are encrypted. This minimizes exposure if the device is compromised.
- Offline-first security posture: Because the app can operate offline, it reduces exposure to external threats during daily work. When online features are used, secure channels and proper validation apply, and you should enable TLS where appropriate for any networked backups or remote synchronization.
- Access control: The UI can be extended with user roles and basic access checks. The initial design focuses on desktop single-user operation, with potential for multi-user scenarios in future iterations.

These measures aim to provide a practical security baseline for a local management tool, balancing usability with protection of sensitive VPN configuration data.
